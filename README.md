# WirelessDisplay
Use another PC as external monitor for your current PC

## Usage

You need a virtual display driver on the host machine to make this work. On Windows, you can use [Virtual-Display-Driver](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver). Haven't figured out a solution for Linux or MacOS yet, because I mainly use Windows as host machine.

## Why build this?

My desk can only fit one desktop monitor, but I have a laptop and want to use it as a second screen. Some solutions exist, but they are either paid, less configurable, or overly complicated. So I decided to build my own.
